Machine Learning for Recommendation Systems 

The future of machine learning lies in unsupervised learning. 

Matrix Factorization(MF) presents a new opportunity for model based collaborative filtering. 

MF aims to learn latent preferences of users and latent attributes of items from known ratings then predict unknown ratings throught dot product of latent features of users & tems

MF can restructre the user-item matrix into low rank strucutre in case of very sparse matrices. 

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a well known matrix factorization method. 
SVD decomposes matrix A into best lower rank (simpler) approximation of original matrix A. 

- Involves analysis of how much users like a particular feature and how relevant the feature is to the recommedations.
